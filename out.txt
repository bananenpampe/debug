==6521== Your program just tried to execute an instruction that Valgrind
==6521== did not recognise.  There are two possible reasons for this.
==6521== 1. Your program has a bug and erroneously jumped to a non-code
==6521==    location.  If you are running Memcheck and you just saw a
==6521==    warning about a bad jump, it's probably your program's fault.
==6521== 2. The instruction is legitimate but Valgrind doesn't handle it,
==6521==    i.e. it's Valgrind's fault.  If you think this is the case or
==6521==    you are not sure, please let us know and we'll try to fix it.
==6521== Either way, Valgrind will now raise a SIGILL signal which will
==6521== probably kill your program.
